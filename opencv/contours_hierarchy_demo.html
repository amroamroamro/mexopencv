         <h2 id="2">Contours</h2>
         <p>Contours can be explained simply as a curve joining all the continuous points (along the boundary), having same color or intensity.
            The contours are a useful tool for shape analysis and object detection and recognition.
         </p>
         <div>
            <ul>
               <li>For better accuracy, use binary images. So before finding contours, apply   threshold or canny edge detection.</li>
               <li>In OpenCV, finding contours is like finding white object from black   background. So remember, object to be found should be
                  white and background   should be black.
               </li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p>There are three arguments in <tt>cv.findContours</tt> function, first one is source image, second is contour retrieval mode, third is contour approximation method. And it outputs
            the contours and hierarchy. The output contours are a cell array of all the contours in the image. Each individual contour
            is a cell array of (x,y) coordinates of boundary points of the object.
         </p>
         <h2 id="3">Drawing Contours</h2>
         <p>To draw the contours, <tt>cv.drawContours</tt> function is used. It can also be used to draw any shape provided you have its boundary points. Its first argument is source
            image, second argument is the contours which should be passed as a cell array, third argument is index of contours (useful
            when drawing individual contour, or -1 to draw all contours). Remaining arguments are color, thickness, etc.
         </p>
         <p>Let's see how to find and draw contours of a binary image:</p><pre class="code-matlab">img = imread(<span class="string">'image.jpg'</span>)
gray = cv.cvtColor(img, <span class="string">'RGB2GRAY'</span>);
bw = cv.threshold(gray, <span class="string">'Otsu'</span>);
[contours,hierarchy] = cv.findContours(bw, <span class="string">'Mode'</span>,<span class="string">'Tree'</span>, <span class="string">'Method'</span>,<span class="string">'Simple'</span>);
img = cv.drawContours(img, contours, <span class="string">'Hierarchy'</span>,hierarchy, <span class="string">'Color'</span>,[0 255 0]);</pre><h2 id="4">Contour Approximation Method</h2>
         <p>This is the third argument in <tt>cv.findContours</tt> function. What does it denote actually?
         </p>
         <p>We previously explained that contours are the boundaries of a shape with the same intensity. It stores the (x,y) coordinates
            of the boundary of a shape. But does it store all the coordinates? That is specified by this contour approximation method.
         </p>
         <p>If you set <tt>Method = None</tt>, all the boundary points are stored. But actually do we need all the points? For example, you found the contour of a straight
            line. Do you need all the points on the line to represent that line? No, we need just two end points of that line. This is
            what <tt>Method = Simple</tt> does. It removes all redundant points and compresses the contour, thereby saving memory.
         </p>
         <p>Below image of a rectangle demonstrate this technique. Just draw a circle on all the coordinates in the contour array (drawn
            in blue color). First image shows points what you got with <tt>None</tt> (734 points) and second image shows the one with <tt>Simple</tt> (only 4 points). See how much memory it saves!
         </p>

         <p>Normally we use the <tt>cv.findContours</tt> function to detect objects in an image, right? Sometimes objects are in different locations. But in some cases, some shapes
            are inside other shapes. Just like nested figures. In this case, we call outer one as <b>parent</b> and inner one as <b>child</b>. This way, contours in an image has some relationship to each other. And we can specify how one contour is connected to each
            other, like, is it child of some other contour, or is it a parent etc. Representation of this relationship is called the <b>Hierarchy</b>.
         </p>
         <p>Consider an example image below :</p>
         <p><img src="https://docs.opencv.org/3.2.0/hierarchy.png"></p>
         <p>In this image, there are a few shapes numbered from <b>0-5</b>. <b>2</b> and <b>2a</b> denote the external and internal contours of the outermost box.
         </p>
         <p>Here, contours <b>0,1,2</b> are <i>external</i> or <i>outermost</i>. We can say, they are in <b>hierarchy-0</b> or simply they are in <i>same hierarchy level</i>.
         </p>
         <p>Next comes <b>contour-2a</b>. It can be considered as a <i>child</i> of <b>contour-2</b> (or in opposite way, <b>contour-2</b> is parent of <b>contour-2a</b>). So let it be in <b>hierarchy-1</b>. Similarly <b>contour-3</b> is child of <b>contour-2</b> and it comes in next hierarchy. Finally contours <b>4,5</b> are the children of <b>contour-3a</b>, and they come in the last hierarchy level. From the way the boxes are numbered, we would say <b>contour-4</b> is the first child of <b>contour-3a</b> (It can be <b>contour-5</b> also).
         </p>
         <p>We mentioned these things to understand terms like <i>same hierarchy level</i>, <i>external contour</i>, <i>child contour</i>, <i>parent contour</i>, <i>first child</i>, etc. Now let's get into OpenCV.
         </p>
         <p>So each contour has its own information regarding what hierarchy it is, who is its child, who is its parent, etc. OpenCV represents
            it as an array of four values: <tt>[Next, Previous, First_Child, Parent]</tt>.
         </p>
         <div>
            <ul>
               <li><tt>Next</tt> denotes next contour at the same hierarchical level
               </li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p>For example, take <b>contour-0</b> in our picture. Who is next contour in its same level? It is <b>contour-1</b>. So simply put <tt>Next = 1</tt>. Similarly for <b>contour-1</b>, next is <b>contour-2</b>. So <tt>Next = 2</tt>.
         </p>
         <p>What about <b>contour-2</b>? There is no next contour in the same level. So simply, put <tt>Next = -1</tt>. What about <b>contour-4</b>? It is in same level with <b>contour-5</b>. So its next contour is <b>contour-5</b>, so <tt>Next = 5</tt>.
         </p>
         <div>
            <ul>
               <li><tt>Previous</tt> denotes previous contour at the same hierarchical level
               </li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p>It is same as above. Previous contour of <b>contour-1</b> is <b>contour-0</b> in the same level. Similarly for <b>contour-2</b>, it is <b>contour-1</b>. And for <b>contour-0</b>, there is no previous, so put it as <tt>-1</tt>.
         </p>
         <div>
            <ul>
               <li><tt>First_Child</tt> denotes its first child contour
               </li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p>There is no need of any explanation. For <b>contour-2</b>, child is <b>contour-2a</b>. So it gets the corresponding index value of <b>contour-2a</b>. What about <b>contour-3a</b>? It has two children. But we take only first child. And it is <b>contour-4</b>. So <tt>First_Child = 4</tt> for <b>contour-3a</b>.
         </p>
         <div>
            <ul>
               <li><tt>Parent</tt> denotes index of its parent contour
               </li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p>It is just opposite of <tt>First_Child</tt>. Both for <b>contour-4</b> and <b>contour-5</b>, parent contour is <b>contour-3a</b>. For <b>contour-3a</b>, it is <b>contour-3</b> and so on.
         </p>
         <p>Note: If there is no child or parent, that field is taken as <tt>-1</tt>.
         </p>
         <h2 id="7">Contour Retrieval Mode</h2>
         <p>So now we know about the hierarchy style used in OpenCV, we can check into Contour Retrieval Modes in OpenCV with the help
            of same image given above.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">img1 = zeros(300, 450, <span class="string">'uint8'</span>);

         <p>This is the simplest of the four flags (from explanation point of view). It simply retrieves all the contours, but doesn't
            create any parent-child relationship. Parents and kids are equal under this rule, and they are just contours, i.e they all
            belongs to same hierarchy level.
         </p>
         <p>So here, 3rd and 4th term in hierarchy array is always <tt>-1</tt>. But obviously, <tt>Next</tt> and <tt>Previous</tt> terms will have their corresponding values. Just check it yourself and verify it.
         </p>
         <p>Below is the result we get, and each row is hierarchy details of corresponding contour. For example, first row corresponds
            to contour 0. Next contour is contour 1. So <tt>Next = 1</tt>. There is no previous contour, so <tt>Previous = -1</tt>. And the remaining two, as told before, it is <tt>-1</tt>.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">[~,hierarchy] = cv.findContours(img1, <span class="string">'Mode'</span>,<span class="string">'List'</span>);
hierarchy = cat(1, hierarchy{:});
display(hierarchy)</pre><pre class="codeoutput">hierarchy =

     6     4    -1    -1
     7     5    -1    -1
    -1     6    -1    -1
</pre><p>This is the good choice to use in your code, if you are not using any hierarchy features.</p>
         <h2 id="12">2. <tt>Mode = External</tt></h2>
         <p>If you use this flag, it returns only extreme outer flags. All child contours are left behind. We can say, under this law,
            only the eldest in every family is taken care of. It doesn't care about other members of the family.
         </p>
         <p>So, in our image, how many extreme outer contours are there? i.e at <b>hierarchy-0</b> level?. Only 3, i.e contours <b>0,1,2</b>, right? Now try to find the contours using this flag. Here also, values given to each element is same as above. Compare it
            with above result. Below is what we get:
         </p><pre class="codeinput">[~,hierarchy] = cv.findContours(img1, <span class="string">'Mode'</span>,<span class="string">'External'</span>);
hierarchy = cat(1, hierarchy{:});
display(hierarchy)</pre><pre class="codeoutput">hierarchy =
     1    -1    -1    -1
     2     0    -1    -1
    -1     1    -1    -1
</pre><p>You can use this flag if you want to extract only the outer contours. It might be useful in some cases.</p>
         <h2 id="14">3. <tt>Mode = CComp</tt></h2>
         <p>This flag retrieves all the contours and arranges them to a 2-level hierarchy, i.e external contours of the object (its boundary)
            are placed in <b>hierarchy-1</b>. And the contours of holes inside object (if any) is placed in <b>hierarchy-2</b>. If any object inside it, its contour is placed again in <b>hierarchy-1</b> only. And its hole in <b>hierarchy-2</b> and so on.
         </p>
         <p>Just consider the image of a "big white zero" on a black background. Outer circle of zero belongs to first hierarchy, and
            inner circle of zero belongs to second hierarchy.
         </p>
         <p>We can explain it with a simple image. Here the order of contours are labelled in red color and the hierarchy they belongs
            to, in green color (either 1 or 2). The order is same as the order OpenCV detects contours.
         </p>
         <p><img src="https://docs.opencv.org/3.2.0/ccomp_hierarchy.png"></p>
         <p>So consider first contour, i.e <b>contour-0</b>. It is <b>hierarchy-1</b>. It has two holes, contours <b>1,2</b>, and they belong to <b>hierarchy-2</b>. So for <b>contour-0</b>, Next contour in same hierarchy level is <b>contour-3</b>. And there is no previous one. And its first is child is <b>contour-1</b> in <b>hierarchy-2</b>. It has no parent, because it is in <b>hierarchy-1</b>. So its hierarchy array is <tt>[3,-1,1,-1]</tt>.
         </p>
         <p>Now take <b>contour-1</b>. It is in <b>hierarchy-2</b>. Next one in same hierarchy (under the parenthood of <b>contour-1</b>) is <b>contour-2</b>. No previous one. No child, but parent is <b>contour-0</b>. So array is <tt>[2,-1,-1,0]</tt>.
         </p>
         <p>Similarly <b>contour-2</b>. It is in <b>hierarchy-2</b>. There is not next contour in same hierarchy under <b>contour-0</b>. So no Next. Previous is <b>contour-1</b>. No child, parent is <b>contour-0</b>. So array is <tt>[-1,1,-1,0]</tt>.
         </p>
         <p><b>contour-3</b>: Next in <b>hierarchy-1</b> is <b>contour-5</b>. Previous is <b>contour-0</b>. Child is <b>contour-4</b> and no parent. So array is <tt>[5,0,4,-1]</tt>.
         </p>
         <p><b>contour-4</b>: It is in <b>hierarchy-2</b> under <b>contour-3</b> and it has no sibling. So no next, no previous, no child, parent is <b>contour-3</b>. So array is <tt>[-1,-1,-1,3]</tt>.
         </p>
         <p>Remaining you can fill up. This is the final answer we get:</p><pre class="codeinput">[~,hierarchy] = cv.findContours(img2, <span class="string">'Mode'</span>,<span class="string">'CComp'</span>);

%% Contours in OpenCV
%
% In the sample, we will:
%
% * Understand what contours are.
% * Learn about the hierarchy of contours, i.e. the parent-child relationship
%   in contours.
% * Learn to find and draw contours using the functions |cv.findContours| and
%   |cv.drawContours|.
%
% Sources:
%
% * <https://docs.opencv.org/3.2.0/d4/d73/tutorial_py_contours_begin.html>
% * <https://docs.opencv.org/3.2.0/d9/d8b/tutorial_py_contours_hierarchy.html>
%

%% Contours
%
% Contours can be explained simply as a curve joining all the continuous
% points (along the boundary), having same color or intensity. The contours
% are a useful tool for shape analysis and object detection and recognition.
%
% * For better accuracy, use binary images. So before finding contours, apply
%   threshold or canny edge detection.
% * In OpenCV, finding contours is like finding white object from black
%   background. So remember, object to be found should be white and background
%   should be black.
%
% There are three arguments in |cv.findContours| function, first one is source
% image, second is contour retrieval mode, third is contour approximation
% method. And it outputs the contours and hierarchy. The output contours are a
% cell array of all the contours in the image. Each individual contour is a
% cell array of (x,y) coordinates of boundary points of the object.
%

%% Drawing Contours
%
% To draw the contours, |cv.drawContours| function is used. It can also be
% used to draw any shape provided you have its boundary points. Its first
% argument is source image, second argument is the contours which should be
% passed as a cell array, third argument is index of contours (useful when
% drawing individual contour, or -1 to draw all contours). Remaining arguments
% are color, thickness, etc.
%
% Let's see how to find and draw contours of a binary image:
%
%   img = imread('image.jpg')
%   gray = cv.cvtColor(img, 'RGB2GRAY');
%   bw = cv.threshold(gray, 'Otsu');
%   [contours,hierarchy] = cv.findContours(bw, 'Mode','Tree', 'Method','Simple');
%   img = cv.drawContours(img, contours, 'Hierarchy',hierarchy, 'Color',[0 255 0]);
%

%% Contour Approximation Method
%
% This is the third argument in |cv.findContours| function. What does it
% denote actually?
%
% We previously explained that contours are the boundaries of a shape with the
% same intensity. It stores the (x,y) coordinates of the boundary of a shape.
% But does it store all the coordinates? That is specified by this contour
% approximation method.
%
% If you set |Method = None|, all the boundary points are stored. But actually
% do we need all the points? For example, you found the contour of a straight
% line. Do you need all the points on the line to represent that line? No, we
% need just two end points of that line. This is what |Method = Simple| does.
% It removes all redundant points and compresses the contour, thereby saving
% memory.
%
% Below image of a rectangle demonstrate this technique. Just draw a circle on
% all the coordinates in the contour array (drawn in blue color). First image
% shows points what you got with |None| (734 points) and second image shows
% the one with |Simple| (only 4 points). See how much memory it saves!
%
% <<https://docs.opencv.org/3.2.0/none.jpg>>
%

% image with a simple rectangular shape
img = zeros(200, 300, 'uint8');
img = cv.rectangle(img, [50 50 200 100], 'Color',255, 'Thickness','Filled');

% find contour w/o approximation
contours = cv.findContours(img, 'Method','None');
cntr1 = cat(1, contours{1}{:});

% find contour w/ approximation
contours = cv.findContours(img, 'Method','Simple');
cntr2 = cat(1, contours{1}{:});

% draw both contours points
out = repmat(img, 1, 1, 3);
out1 = cv.circle(out, cntr1, 3, 'Color',[255 0 0], 'Thickness','Filled');
out2 = cv.circle(out, cntr2, 3, 'Color',[255 0 0], 'Thickness','Filled');

% compare results
subplot(121), imshow(out1)
title({'Method = None', sprintf('%d points', size(cntr1,1))})
subplot(122), imshow(out2)
title({'Method = Simlpe', sprintf('%d points', size(cntr2,1))})

%% Contours Hierarchy
%
% Normally we use the |cv.findContours| function to detect objects in an
% image, right? Sometimes objects are in different locations. But in some
% cases, some shapes are inside other shapes. Just like nested figures. In
% this case, we call outer one as *parent* and inner one as *child*. This way,
% contours in an image has some relationship to each other. And we can specify
% how one contour is connected to each other, like, is it child of some other
% contour, or is it a parent etc. Representation of this relationship is
% called the *Hierarchy*.
%
% Consider an example image below :
%
% <<https://docs.opencv.org/3.2.0/hierarchy.png>>
%
% In this image, there are a few shapes numbered from *0-5*. *2* and *2a*
% denote the external and internal contours of the outermost box.
%
% Here, contours *0,1,2* are _external_ or _outermost_. We can say, they are
% in *hierarchy-0* or simply they are in _same hierarchy level_.
%
% Next comes *contour-2a*. It can be considered as a _child_ of *contour-2*
% (or in opposite way, *contour-2* is parent of *contour-2a*). So let it be in
% *hierarchy-1*. Similarly *contour-3* is child of *contour-2* and it comes in
% next hierarchy. Finally contours *4,5* are the children of *contour-3a*, and
% they come in the last hierarchy level. From the way the boxes are numbered,
% we would say *contour-4* is the first child of *contour-3a* (It can be
% *contour-5* also).
%
% We mentioned these things to understand terms like _same hierarchy level_,
% _external contour_, _child contour_, _parent contour_, _first child_, etc.
% Now let's get into OpenCV.
%

%%
% So each contour has its own information regarding what hierarchy it is, who
% is its child, who is its parent, etc. OpenCV represents it as an array of
% four values: |[Next, Previous, First_Child, Parent]|.
%
% * |Next| denotes next contour at the same hierarchical level
%
% For example, take *contour-0* in our picture. Who is next contour in its
% same level? It is *contour-1*. So simply put |Next = 1|. Similarly for
% *contour-1*, next is *contour-2*. So |Next = 2|.
%
% What about *contour-2*? There is no next contour in the same level. So
% simply, put |Next = -1|. What about *contour-4*? It is in same level with
% *contour-5*. So its next contour is *contour-5*, so |Next = 5|.
%
% * |Previous| denotes previous contour at the same hierarchical level
%
% It is same as above. Previous contour of *contour-1* is *contour-0* in the
% same level. Similarly for *contour-2*, it is *contour-1*. And for
% *contour-0*, there is no previous, so put it as |-1|.
%
% * |First_Child| denotes its first child contour
%
% There is no need of any explanation. For *contour-2*, child is *contour-2a*.
% So it gets the corresponding index value of *contour-2a*. What about
% *contour-3a*? It has two children. But we take only first child. And it is
% *contour-4*. So |First_Child = 4| for *contour-3a*.
%
% * |Parent| denotes index of its parent contour
%
% It is just opposite of |First_Child|. Both for *contour-4* and *contour-5*,
% parent contour is *contour-3a*. For *contour-3a*, it is *contour-3* and so
% on.
%
% Note: If there is no child or parent, that field is taken as |-1|.
%

%% Contour Retrieval Mode
%
% So now we know about the hierarchy style used in OpenCV, we can check into
% Contour Retrieval Modes in OpenCV with the help of same image given above.
%

%%
img1 = zeros(300, 450, 'uint8');
img1 = cv.line(img1, [30 10], [100 10], 'Color',255, 'Thickness',4);
img1 = cv.line(img1, [120 15], [430 15], 'Color',255, 'Thickness',4);
img1 = cv.rectangle(img1, [20 60 400 220], 'Color',255, 'Thickness',2);
img1 = cv.rectangle(img1, [50 100 340 150], 'Color',255, 'Thickness',2);
img1 = cv.rectangle(img1, [90 130 140 100], 'Color',255, 'Thickness','Filled');
img1 = cv.rectangle(img1, [260 155 100 50], 'Color',255, 'Thickness','Filled');
figure, imshow(img1), title('Image 1')

%%
img2 = zeros(300, 450, 'uint8');
img2 = cv.line(img2, [30 10], [100 10], 'Color',255, 'Thickness',4);
img2 = cv.line(img2, [120 15], [430 15], 'Color',255, 'Thickness',4);
img2 = cv.rectangle(img2, [20 60 400 220], 'Color',255, 'Thickness',2);
img2 = cv.rectangle(img2, [50 100 340 150], 'Color',255, 'Thickness',2);
img2 = cv.rectangle(img2, [90 130 140 100], 'Color',255, 'Thickness','Filled');
img2 = cv.rectangle(img2, [105 150 100 20], 'Color',0, 'Thickness','Filled');
img2 = cv.rectangle(img2, [105 190 100 30], 'Color',0, 'Thickness','Filled');
figure, imshow(img2), title('Image 2')

%% 1. |Mode = List|
%
% This is the simplest of the four flags (from explanation point of view). It
% simply retrieves all the contours, but doesn't create any parent-child
% relationship. Parents and kids are equal under this rule, and they are just
% contours, i.e they all belongs to same hierarchy level.
%
% So here, 3rd and 4th term in hierarchy array is always |-1|. But obviously,
% |Next| and |Previous| terms will have their corresponding values. Just check
% it yourself and verify it.
%
% Below is the result we get, and each row is hierarchy details of
% corresponding contour. For example, first row corresponds to contour 0.
% Next contour is contour 1. So |Next = 1|. There is no previous contour, so
% |Previous = -1|. And the remaining two, as told before, it is |-1|.

[~,hierarchy] = cv.findContours(img1, 'Mode','List');
hierarchy = cat(1, hierarchy{:});
display(hierarchy)

%%
% This is the good choice to use in your code, if you are not using any
% hierarchy features.
%

%% 2. |Mode = External|
%
% If you use this flag, it returns only extreme outer flags. All child
% contours are left behind. We can say, under this law, only the eldest in
% every family is taken care of. It doesn't care about other members of the
% family.
%
% So, in our image, how many extreme outer contours are there? i.e at
% *hierarchy-0* level?. Only 3, i.e contours *0,1,2*, right? Now try to find
% the contours using this flag. Here also, values given to each element is
% same as above. Compare it with above result. Below is what we get:

[~,hierarchy] = cv.findContours(img1, 'Mode','External');
hierarchy = cat(1, hierarchy{:});
display(hierarchy)

%%
% You can use this flag if you want to extract only the outer contours. It
% might be useful in some cases.
%

%% 3. |Mode = CComp|
%
% This flag retrieves all the contours and arranges them to a 2-level
% hierarchy, i.e external contours of the object (its boundary) are placed in
% *hierarchy-1*. And the contours of holes inside object (if any) is placed in
% *hierarchy-2*. If any object inside it, its contour is placed again in
% *hierarchy-1* only. And its hole in *hierarchy-2* and so on.
%
% Just consider the image of a "big white zero" on a black background. Outer
% circle of zero belongs to first hierarchy, and inner circle of zero belongs
% to second hierarchy.
%
% We can explain it with a simple image. Here the order of contours are
% labelled in red color and the hierarchy they belongs to, in green color
% (either 1 or 2). The order is same as the order OpenCV detects contours.
%
% <<https://docs.opencv.org/3.2.0/ccomp_hierarchy.png>>
%
% So consider first contour, i.e *contour-0*. It is *hierarchy-1*. It has two
% holes, contours *1,2*, and they belong to *hierarchy-2*. So for *contour-0*,
% Next contour in same hierarchy level is *contour-3*. And there is no
% previous one. And its first is child is *contour-1* in *hierarchy-2*. It has
% no parent, because it is in *hierarchy-1*. So its hierarchy array is
% |[3,-1,1,-1]|.
%
% Now take *contour-1*. It is in *hierarchy-2*. Next one in same hierarchy
% (under the parenthood of *contour-1*) is *contour-2*. No previous one. No
% child, but parent is *contour-0*. So array is |[2,-1,-1,0]|.
%
% Similarly *contour-2*. It is in *hierarchy-2*. There is not next contour in
% same hierarchy under *contour-0*. So no Next. Previous is *contour-1*. No
% child, parent is *contour-0*. So array is |[-1,1,-1,0]|.
%
% *contour-3*: Next in *hierarchy-1* is *contour-5*. Previous is *contour-0*.
% Child is *contour-4* and no parent. So array is |[5,0,4,-1]|.
%
% *contour-4*: It is in *hierarchy-2* under *contour-3* and it has no sibling.
% So no next, no previous, no child, parent is *contour-3*. So array is
% |[-1,-1,-1,3]|.
%
% Remaining you can fill up. This is the final answer we get:
%

[~,hierarchy] = cv.findContours(img2, 'Mode','CComp');
hierarchy = cat(1, hierarchy{:});
display(hierarchy)

%% 4. |Mode = Tree|
%
% It retrieves all the contours and creates a full family hierarchy list. It
% even tells, who is the grandpa, father, son, grandson and even beyond...
%
% For examle, take the above image, run it with |Mode = Tree|, reorder the
% contours as per the result given by OpenCV and analyze it. Again, red
% letters give the contour number and green letters give the hierarchy order.
%
% <<https://docs.opencv.org/3.2.0/tree_hierarchy.png>>
%
% Take *contour-0*: It is in *hierarchy-0*. Next contour in same hierarchy is
% *contour-7*. No previous contours. Child is *contour-1*. And no parent. So
% array is |[7,-1,1,-1]|.
%
% Take *contour-1*: It is in *hierarchy-1*. No contour in same level. No
% previous one. Child is *contour-2*. Parent is *contour-0*. So array is
% |[-1,-1,2,0]|.
%
% The remaining is similar. Below is the full answer:
%

[~,hierarchy] = cv.findContours(img2, 'Mode','Tree');
hierarchy = cat(1, hierarchy{:});
display(hierarchy)
